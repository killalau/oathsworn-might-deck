- displyaing the remaining blanks and crits in each deck
- displaying the probability for a hit for any combination of cards to be drawn from the four decks
- displaying the expected value for the damage drawn
  - for the individual decks, i.e., the expected value for the next card drawn from each individual deck
  - for any combination of cards to be drawn from the four decks
