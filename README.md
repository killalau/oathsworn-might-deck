# Oathsworn Might Deck Tool

Web app to replace the physical might decks with a digital version when playing the boardgame "Oathsworn: Into the Deepwood".
The entire front end has been coded by killalau. DrDonik added the statistics.

Features of this digital implementation:
- managing card draws and deck reshuffling
- displyaing the remaining blanks and crits in each deck
- displaying the probability for a hit for any combination of cards to be drawn from the four decks
- displaying the expected value for the damage drawn
 - for the individual decks, i.e., the expected value for the next card drawn from each individual deck
 - for any combination of cards to be drawn from the four decks
